+++ Minimal Exercises to be done for evaluation 
[[ notice the OR statement ]]

 1) Ex. 2.5.1: Critical Slowing Down in the 2D Ising Model

 2a) Ex. 3.2.1: VMC optimization with gradients
                   OR
 2b) Ex. 3.1.4: VMC for the Helium atom 

 
                   
 3a) Ex. 5.4.2: PIMC for TFIM (ex 5.4.1 strongly recommended as prerequisite)
                   OR
 3b) Ex. 4.5.1: Single-walker DMC for the Helium atom

So avilable combination are 1-2a-3a; 1-2a-3b; 1-2b-3a; 1-2b-3b
Disclaimer: for Ex. 4.5.1 you need the local energy computed in Ex. 3.1.4, so be advised if you choose the "path" 1-2a-3b.
